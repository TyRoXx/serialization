Serialization library for C++
=============================

How to use
----------

You can find samples of usage in src/examples/.


Requirements
------------

Currently the code works with GCC 4.4+ and Clang 3.0+.  Visual C++ 2010 will be
supported.  We will try to support older versions of GCC, Clang and VC++ as
well.

Some utilities and the unit test framework from Boost are required.  Any Boost
release since 1.40 should work.  We recommend more recent releases though.


Things to do
------------

There is a list of ideas in TODO.md


License
-------

Currently undecided. Most likely MIT.
