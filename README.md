Serialization library for C++
=============================

How to use
----------

You can find samples of usage in src/examples/ (more to do).


Supported compilers
-------------------

* GCC >= 4.3
* Visual C++ 2010

GCC 4.2 and Clang have problems with Boost.Preprocessor.  I will try to fix that.


Dependencies
------------

Some header-only libraries and the unit test framework from Boost are required.
Any Boost release since 1.48 should work.
We recommend more recent releases though.


Things to do
------------

There is a list of ideas in TODO.md


License
-------

Currently undecided. Most likely MIT.
